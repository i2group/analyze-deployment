This section describes the process of creating a new Docker container that represents the extra Solr server, and adding a Solr node on that server to the existing Solr collection. Before you begin Create a directory named solr3 in the src/images/common directory, and copy the contents of the src/images/common/solr directory into the new solr3 directory. Modifying the Dockerfile In the Docker environment, create another container to represent the extra server. The new container is a copy of the Solr container, which is modified to use a different host name and port. Modify the Dockerfile in the src/images/common/solr3 directory to specify the host name and port to expose: Set the ARG instruction to ARG hostname=solr3.eianet . This is the host name of the new container. Set the EXPOSE instruction to EXPOSE 8985 . This is the port that is exposed to enable a connection the Solr web UI. Adding the Solr node to the topology.xml Modify the topology.xml in the src/images/common/solr3/configuration/environment directory to include the new host name and ports that are specified in the Dockerfile .

    "keywords": "Adding Solr replicas to your deployment If a logical shard in the Solr collection becomes unusable, then the search index also becomes unusable. To increase the resilience of the search index, replicas of shards can be created that are distinct from their original shard. These replicas can be located on different physical servers. A replica acts as a physical copy of a shard in a SolrCloud Collection. After you change the Solr collection in a live deployment, replicate the changes in the definition of how the Solr collection is created. Adding replicas to the Solr collection definition After you identify how many replicas you require, add them to your Solr collection definition: If your Solr collection is configured by the createSolrCollection script, increase the replication factor for your collection in the CREATE call to the Solr Collections API. If your Solr collection is configured by the toolkit, increase the value of the num-replicas attribute for your collection in the topology.xml file. For example, if you want to have two replicas of each shard, increase the replicationFactor or num-replicas value to 2. The next time that the Solr collection is created by the toolkit, it is created with the replication factor that you specified in the topology.xml file or the createSolrCollection script. You only need to complete the following steps when you are adding replicas to a live system. If you do add replicas to the live system, ensure that you update the collection definition. Adding replicas to a live collection Add a replica of each shard in the Solr collection. To add a replica of each shard in the distributed deployment example, enter the following lines into the URL field in a web browser: http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=ADDREPLICA&collection=main_index&shard=shard1&node=solr2.eianet:8984_solr http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=ADDREPLICA&collection=main_index&shard=shard2&node=solr.eianet:8983_solr http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=ADDREPLICA&collection=main_index&shard=shard3&node=solr2.eianet:8984_solr http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=ADDREPLICA&collection=main_index&shard=shard4&node=solr.eianet:8983_solr These send a REST call to the Solr Collections API to add a replica of a specific shard on a specific node. Each of the shards now has an extra replica, on a different node to the original shard. For more information about the ADDREPLICA call, see ADDREPLICA: Add replicas . To prepare the REST calls, you must know the collection name, the shard to replicate, and the node to add the replica to. To identify the node name, go to the Tree View of SolrCloud in the Solr Web UI on any of your running Solr servers. For example: http://localhost:8983/solr/#/~cloud?view=tree Go to /live_nodes , and choose the name of the node that you want to move your replica to. For example: solr2.eianet:8984_solr Note: Only live Solr nodes are displayed. You can use this method to choose the number of replicas to create, and where they are located. To show the Graph View that shows replicas in the Solr Web UI, connect to the Solr Web UI by using the following URL: http://localhost:8983/solr/#/~cloud . The user name is solradmin and the password is the Solr password set in the credentials.properties file. Important: After you change the Solr collection in a live deployment, replicate the changes in the definition of how the Solr collection is created. Testing the replicas To test that the replicas are added successfully, and that your system has a level of redundancy, stop one of the Solr nodes.

The newly created replicas are now the leaders for the shards. If you do a Quick Search by using Analyst's Notebook Premium, any data that was in the Information Store is still available. You can start the solr container, and the Solr node starts again. To start the solr container, run the following command: docker exec -u i2analyze -t solr /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/scripts/setup -t startSolrNodes --hostname solr.eianet In the Solr Web UI Tree View , you can see that the Solr node and shards are active."

    "keywords": "Adding Solr shards to your deployment You can modify the Solr configuration by using the Solr Collections API . After you change the Solr collection in a live deployment, replicate the changes in the definition of how the Solr collection is created. Overview When you first deploy i2 Analyze, you should create a Solr collection that comprises enough shards to satisfy your future data requirements. If your data requirements change, you can add more shards to your deployment. Adding a shard to the Solr collection definition After you identify the number of shards that you require, add them to your Solr collection definition: If your Solr collection is configured by the createSolrCollection script, increase the number of shards for your collection in the CREATE call to the Solr Collections API. If your Solr collection is configured by the toolkit, increase the value of the num-shards attribute for your collection in the topology.xml file. The next time that the Solr collection is created by the toolkit, it is created with the number of shards that you specify. The following steps are only required when you want to add a shard to a live deployment. Adding a shard to a live collection In the Solr collections that are created by i2 Analyze, the compositeId router is used, which means that you cannot add shards explicitly. To add a shard to an existing collection, you must split an existing one. If you add a shard to a live collection, you must replicate the same changes to your Solr collection creation definition. Splitting a shard To split shard1 in the distributed deployment example, enter the following line into the URL field in a web browser: http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=SPLITSHARD&collection=main_index&shard=shard1 This sends a REST call to the Solr Collections API to split shard1 . For more information about the SPLITSHARD call, see SPLITSHARD: Split a shard . The process of splitting a shard creates two new shards from the original shard. When a shard is split, the names of the two new shards that are created are the name of the original shard that is suffixed with _0 and _1 . The original shard becomes inactive as soon as the new shards and their replicas are up. The replication factor of the original shard is maintained. If your shard had two replicas, when it is split each new shard also has two replicas. Note: The new shards are always placed on the same node as the parent shard. Deleting the inactive shard You can remove the inactive shard1 from the collection. To delete the shard, enter the following line into the URL field in a web browser and press Enter : http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=DELETESHARD&shard=shard1&collection=main_index This sends a REST call to the Solr Collections API to delete shard1 . For more information about the DELETESHARD call, see DELETESHARD: Delete a shard . You can now either test or the deployment, or move the new shard to another Solr node. Moving a shard to another node If you want to move one of the new split shards, you must create a replica of it on another node and then delete the original. To create the REST call to do this, you must know the collection name, the shard to replicate, and the node to add the replica to. To identify the node name, navigate to the Tree View of SolrCLoud in the Solr Web UI on any of your running Solr servers. For example: http://localhost:8983/solr/#/~cloud?view=tree Go to /live_nodes and choose the name of the node that you want to move your replica to. For example: solr3.eianet:8985_solr Note: Only live Solr nodes are displayed. To add a replica of the new shard1_1 shard to the new Solr node 3, paste the following line into your browser: http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=ADDREPLICA&collection=main_index&shard=shard1_1&node=solr3.eianet:8985_solr This sends a REST call to the Solr Collections API to create a replica of shard1_1 on solr3 that is on port 8985. For more information about the ADDREPLICA call, see ADDREPLICA: Add replicas . Deleting the original replica To delete the original replica that was created when the shard was split, you must have the name of the replica to remove. To get the replica name, go to the Tree View of SolrCLoud in the Solr Web UI. For example: http://localhost:8983/solr/#/~cloud?view=tree Go to /collections/main_index/state.json . This file describes the composition of your collection. Identify the replica to delete by looking at the shard that the replica replicates, and the node that the replica is located. In this example, the replica to remove is shards.shard1_1.replicas.core_node6 . To delete this replica, paste the following line into your browser: http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=DELETEREPLICA&collection=main_index&shard=shard1_1&replica=core_node6 This sends a REST call to the Solr Collections API to delete the first replica of shard1_1 that was on node solr2 .

    "keywords": "Creating a Solr collection using the createSolrCollection script file Your createSolrCollection script in the toolkit\\configuration\\environment\\opal-server\\main_index directory must contain a CREATE call to the Solr Collections API. Before you begin You must specify that you are using the createSolrCollection script to configure Solr. For more information, see Choosing the method for configuring Solr . CREATE REST call To create a collection, use the CREATE REST call in the createSolrCollection file. For more information about the CREATE REST call, and extra parameters that you can use, see CREATE: Create a Collection . To create a collection, open the createSolrCollection script in a text editor. The existing script might contain a CREATE call that is similar to the following example: curl ?CERTIFICATE_PLACEHOLDER? ?CREDENTIALS_PLACEHOLDER? \"?SCHEME_PLACEHOLDER?://solr.eianet:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=CREATE&name=main_index&collection.configName=main_index&numShards=4&maxShardsPerNode=4&replicationFactor=1\" The ?CERTIFICATE_PLACEHOLDER?, ?CREDENTIALS_PLACEHOLDER?, ?SCHEME_PLACEHOLDER? variables are resolved by the toolkit when the script is run. This example of a CREATE call creates a collection that has the following attributes: Named main_index A configuration named main_index in ZooKeeper Four shards A maximum of four shards per node One replica of each shard Recreating the collection After you change the createSolrCollection script, you can recreate the Solr collection by completing the following steps. To stop Liberty, run the following command: docker exec -u i2analyze liberty /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/scripts/setup -t stopLiberty The output from the stopLiberty task is output directly to the console. To remove the current Solr collection, run the following command: docker exec -it -u i2analyze admin_client /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/scripts/setup -t deleteSolrCollections --all --hostname admin_client.eianet To create the Solr collection with the modified configuration, run the following command: docker exec -t -u i2analyze admin_client /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/scripts/setup -t createSolrCollections --all --hostname admin_client.eianet To clear the search index, run the following command: docker exec -u i2analyze -it admin_client /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/scripts/setup -t clearSearchIndex --all --hostname admin_client.eianet To restart Liberty, run the following command: docker exec -u i2analyze liberty /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/scripts/setup -t startLiberty The console output from the startLiberty task is output directly to the console. Liberty is now started and you can connect to i2 Analyze. Modifying a collection If you change the configuration of your Solr collection on a live deployment, you must replicate the changes in your createSolrCollection script. This ensures that if your Solr collection is recreated, it aligns with your configuration changes. For example, if you add two shards to your live collection, you must increase the number of shards in the collection definition by 2. For information about changing the Solr collection configuration on a live deployment, see Adding another Solr server and Solr node , Adding Solr shards to your deployment , and Adding Solr replicas to your deployment . Note: If you add Solr nodes to your deployment after the Solr Collection is created, your CREATE call might distribute your original shards and replicas on different nodes. You must inspect your createSolrCollection script and ensure that it works if your Solr collection is created with the new nodes present from the start."

    "title": "Choosing the method for configuring Solr",
    "keywords": "Choosing the method for configuring Solr A deployment of i2 Analyze uses Solr to manage the search index. i2 Analyze requires at least one Solr collection that consists of nodes, shards, and replicas. The Solr configuration can be controlled through the topology.xml file, or through the createSolrCollection script. Regardless of how Solr is configured, the collection is created by i2 Analyze. If the collection is configured through the topology.xml file, the modifications that you can complete are limited to those that are supported in the topology.xml file. If the collection is managed through the createSolrCollection script, you can complete all the modifications that are supported by the Solr Collections API. The createSolrCollection script file contains REST calls to the Solr Collections API to configure the Solr collection. The script uses curl commands to make the REST calls. Note: You must install curl on your path to use the createSolrCollection script as it is generated. Configure the Solr collection in the topology.xml file By default, or when toolkit-configured=\"true\" in the solr-collection element of the topology.xml file, the Solr collection is created by using the definitions in the topology.xml file. For example, the <solr-collection> element is defined as follows: <solr-collection toolkit-configured=\"true\" num-replicas=\"1\" id=\"main_index\" max-shards-per-node=\"4\" num-shards=\"4\"/> For more information about configuring the collection and the values that you can set in the topology file, see ZooKeeper and Solr . The Solr collection is created when the createSolrCollections toolkit task is run the first time. After, you can use the clearSearchIndex toolkit task. This task clears the search index, and then recreates the collection. When Liberty starts, the search index is recreated. Configure the Solr collection in the createSolrCollection script file If you deployed the distributed deployment example, the createSolrCollection script is in the toolkit\\configuration\\environment\\opal-server\\main_index directory on the server that the createSolrCollection script was run. You can then change the topology file to toolkit-configured=\"false\" . Note: If the script doesn't exist, run setup -t createSolrCollections toolkit task with toolkit-configured=\"true\" in the topology.xml file. If toolkit-configured=\"false\" in the topology.xml file, the createSolrCollection script is used to configure the Solr collection. For example, the <solr-collection> element is defined as follows: <solr-collection toolkit-configured=\"false\" num-replicas=\"1\" id=\"main_index\" max-shards-per-node=\"4\" num-shards=\"4\"/> The script file contains the Solr collection configuration from the topology.xml file. You can then modify the Solr Collections API CREATE call in the script file. When i2 Analyze recreates the Solr collection, it uses the call in this file. For more information about configuring the collection by using the script, see Creating a Solr collection using the createSolrCollection script . Managing changes to the createSolrCollection script file The script file contains the definition of your Solr collection. You must keep a copy of the createSolrCollection in a source control system to ensure that the REST call required to make your Solr collection is maintained. You might need to use previous versions of this file when you move from a test to a production system, or when you make a configuration change that you later decide is incorrect."

    "keywords": "Deploying the distributed deployment example manually for Db2 The manual deployment of the distributed deployment example requires you to run each of the steps that were completed automatically in the Quick deploy, but for IBM Db2. The following instructions detail what steps are required on each container, and how to use these steps to deploy i2 Analyze on physical servers. Important : The distributed example uses a Docker environment to demonstrate a distributed deployment of i2 Analyze. The Docker environment is not designed to be used on customer sites for test or production systems. After you understand how the distributed deployment is deployed, replicate the deployment on physical servers. Before you begin Complete the Quick deploy section at least once, before you start the manual deployment. The software prerequisites that you download for the Quick deploy are also used here. Complete the Clean your environment section to ensure that none of the images, containers, or network exist. You must run all Docker commands from a command line where Docker is initialized. For Windows 7, you must also forward the required ports from your local workstation to the virtual machine that hosts Docker. In the network settings for your docker virtual machine, open the Advanced menu and click Port Forwarding . Create a new line, and enter values for the Host IP , Host Port , and Guest Port . You must do this for each port that is exposed in the Docker environment. Db2 Download IBM Db2 Advanced Edition for Linux by using the usual mechanism. Unzip the DB2_DAE_Activation_11.5.zip file, then copy the adv_vpc directory into the src/images/db2/db2_installer directory. Rename the DB2_Svr_11.5_Linux_x86-64.tar.gz file to DB2_AWSE_REST_Svr.tar.gz , then copy it to the src/images/db2/db2_installer/installation_media directory. Do not decompress the file. Download the SSL support file for Db2 by using the usual mechanism. Rename the DB2_SF_SSL_11.5_Linux_x86-64.tar.gz file to DB2_SF_SSLF.tar.gz , then copy it to the src/images/db2/base_client/installation_media directory. Do not decompress the file. Add the db2jcc4.jar file to the src/configuration/environment/common/jdbc-drivers directory. Note: In an installation of Db2, the db2jcc4.jar file is in the IBM/SQLLIB/java directory. If you do not have a Db2 installation, you can download the file. Download the file for v11.5 FP0 (GA) . For more information about downloading the db2jcc4.jar file, see: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21363866 . Create the network To enable communication between the docker containers, all the containers must be connected to a single network. You can create a bridge network that only the docker containers can access. When each container is run, the --net flag is used to specify that the container connects to a specific network. Create a bridge network called eianet for the distributed deployment example: docker network create eianet Test that the network is created: docker network ls The eianet network is displayed in the list. In a non-Docker environment, ensure that each server that you are using to deploy i2 Analyze can connect to each other. Copy the i2 Analyze configuration Update the distributed deployment example configuration for Db2. Copy the src/configuration_mods/db2/base/environment directory to the src/configuration directory. Accept any file overwrites. The i2 Analyze configuration is required by all servers that host components of i2 Analyze, except for the database server. In the src/scripts directory of the distributed deployment example, the copyConfiguration script copies the i2 Analyze configuration from the src/configuration directory to the src/images/<container_name>/configuration directory for each container. From the src/scripts directory, run the copyConfiguration script file. ./copyConfiguration db2 Results In a non-Docker environment, copying the configuration is equivalent to the following steps: Downloading and extracting the i2 Analyze toolkit onto a server. Copying the examples/configurations/information-store-opal/configuration directory into the toolkit directory of your extracted i2 Analyze toolkit. You must populate the configuration for your environment, use the src/configuration directory as a reference. This is the centralized i2 Analyze toolkit and configuration that you copy to your servers. Build the prerequisite images In the distributed deployment example, some of the images are built on top of other images. The prerequisite images must be built first, as described in the following section. Ubuntu toolkit image The ubuntu_toolkit_image is an image that contains the Ubuntu operating system with i2 Analyze installed and contains the i2 Analyze configuration. When you build the ubuntu_toolkit_image , the i2analyze.tar.gz that you copied into the src/images/common/ubuntu_toolkit/i2analyze directory as part of the Quick deploy is copied and extracted into the image. To build the Ubuntu toolkit image, run the following from the src/images/common folder: docker build -t ubuntu_toolkit_image ubuntu_toolkit The Ubuntu toolkit image is created with the name ubuntu_toolkit_image . Db2 installer image The Db2 installation files must be added to the db2_installer_image . To build the db2_installer image, run the following from the src/images/db2 folder: docker build -t db2_installer_image db2_installer The db2_installer image is created with the name db2_installer_image . The prerequisite packages and Db2 installer files are installed. Base client image The base_client represents a system that has the configured i2 Analyze toolkit and Db2 Client. This is used by any container that must communicate with Db2. To build the base_client_image image, run the following from the src/images/db2 folder: docker build -t base_client_image base_client Configuring and running the containers Each Docker container requires a Docker image. In a non-Docker environment, this is equivalent to configuring and starting a physical server that is used to host a component of i2 Analyze. Db2 container In i2 Analyze, the Information Store is a Db2 database. To make it easier to demonstrate, the installation of Db2 is automated. In this deployment, Db2 is installed on its own server. To build the db2 image, run the following from the src/images/db2 folder: docker build -t db2_image db2 The DB2 image is created with the name db2_image . Run the db2 container: docker run -d --privileged --name db2 -p 50000:50000 -p 50001:50001 --net eianet -u db2inst1 db2_image Note: Ports 50000 and 50001 are exposed so that the database can be accessed from outside of the eianet network. In a production environment this is not necessary, because clients only access Liberty. Check that the container started correctly by using the docker logs: docker logs -f db2 Note: To exit the log display, use Ctrl + C . After you run the Db2 container, set the password for the i2analyze user. Enter the password that you specified in the credentials.properties file for the db2.infostore.password credential. To set the password, run the following command and enter the password when you are prompted: docker exec -u root -it db2 passwd i2analyze Inspect the Dockerfile in the src/images/db2/db2 directory to see the commands that are required to install DB2 on a server in a non-Docker environment. Db2 is installed by using a response file, and an instance of Db2 is created with the required Db2 users. ZooKeeper containers ZooKeeper is the service that is used to maintain configuration information and distributed synchronization across Solr. In this deployment, ZooKeeper is distributed across three servers in a ZooKeeper Quorum. Your configured i2 Analyze toolkit must be installed on each Zookeeper server. To build the zookeeper , zookeeper2 , and zookeeper3 images, run the following commands from the src/images/common folder: docker build -t zookeeper_image zookeeper docker build -t zookeeper2_image zookeeper2 docker build -t zookeeper3_image zookeeper3 Run the ZooKeeper containers: docker run -d --name zookeeper --net eianet --memory=512m -u i2analyze zookeeper_image docker run -d --name zookeeper2 --net eianet --memory=512m -u i2analyze zookeeper2_image docker run -d --name zookeeper3 --net eianet --memory=512m -u i2analyze zookeeper3_image Check that the containers started correctly by using the docker logs: docker logs -f zookeeper docker logs -f zookeeper2 docker logs -f zookeeper3 Inspect the Dockerfile in the src/images/common/zookeeper directory to see the commands that are required to configure a ZooKeeper server in a non-Docker environment. Each ZooKeeper container is started. The container starts and configures ZooKeeper, and hosts the ZooKeeper server. The topology.xml file in the i2 Analyze configuration defines the values for the ZooKeeper server. Admin client container In this deployment, the Admin client is a separate server that is designed for running toolkit tasks in a distributed environment. Your configured i2 Analyze toolkit, and a DB2 client must be installed on the server that you want to use to interact with Liberty and Db2. To build the Admin client image, run the following command from the src/images/db2 folder: docker build -t admin_client_db2_image admin_client The Admin client image is created with the name admin_client_db2_image . Run the Admin client container: docker run -d --name admin_client --net eianet -u i2analyze admin_client_db2_image Inspect the Dockerfile in the src/images/db2/admin_client directory to see the commands that are required to configure the Admin client. Use the following format to run toolkit tasks by using the Admin Client: docker exec -u i2analyze -t admin_client /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/scripts/setup -t <toolkit task> Solr configuration Before the Solr configuration can be created, all of the ZooKeeper hosts must be running. In the Docker environment, ensure that the ZooKeeper containers are running. You can create and upload the Solr configuration from the Admin client, or you can run the command from one of the ZooKeeper servers. To create the Solr configuration by using the Admin client, run the following command: docker exec -u i2analyze -t admin_client /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/scripts/setup -t createAndUploadSolrConfig --hostname admin_client.eianet The Solr configuration is created and uploaded. Solr containers Solr is used to manage the search index in a deployment of i2 Analyze. In this deployment, Solr is distributed across two servers. Your configured i2 Analyze toolkit must be installed on each Solr server. To build the Solr images, run the following commands from the src/images/common folder: docker build -t solr_image solr docker build -t solr2_image solr2 The Solr images are created with the names solr_image and solr2_image . Run the Solr containers: docker run -d --name solr -p 8983:8983 --net eianet --memory=1g -u i2analyze solr_image docker run -d --name solr2 -p 8984:8984 --net eianet --memory=1g -u i2analyze solr2_image Check that the containers started correctly by using the docker logs: docker logs -f solr docker logs -f solr2 Inspect the Dockerfile in src/images/common/solr and src/images/common/solr2 to see the commands that are required to configure a Solr server in a non-Docker environment. The images include an i2 Analyze topology.xml file that defines the values for the configuration of Solr. When the server starts, the appropriate Solr nodes are started. When you start the Solr container, the port that Solr runs on in the container is specified, in this example it is either 8983 or 8984 . The specified port is mapped on the host machine so that you can access Solr and the Solr web UI from the host machine. After the Solr nodes are running, you can use the Solr Web UI to inspect the Solr and ZooKeeper configurations. Connect to the Solr Web UI on the solr container. In a web browser, go to the following URL to connect to the Solr Web UI: http://localhost:8983/solr/# . The user name is solradmin and the password is the Solr password set in the credentials.properties file. Where the port number is the same as the one that is mapped to local machine when the Solr container is run. The URL uses localhost because the 8983 port is mapped from the host machine to the docker container. In a non-Docker environment, connect by using the host name of the Solr server. Solr collection Before the Solr collection can be created, all of the Solr nodes that the collection comprises must be running. In the Docker environment, ensure that both of the Solr containers are running. You can create the Solr collection from the Admin client, or you can run the command from one of the Solr servers. To create the Solr collection by using the Admin client, run the following command: docker exec -u i2analyze -t admin_client /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/scripts/setup -t createSolrCollections --hostname admin_client.eianet The Solr collection is created. To test the Solr Collection, click Cloud in the Solr Web UI, or you can go to http://localhost:8983/solr/#/~cloud . The user name is solradmin and the password is the Solr password set in the credentials.properties file. A horizontal tree with the collection as the root is displayed. Here you can see the breakdown of the shards, nodes, and replicas on the collection. Create the Information Store database Create the Information Store database in the Db2 instance on the Db2 container. To create the Information Store database by using the Admin client, run the following command: docker exec -t -u i2analyze admin_client bash -c \". home/db2inst1/sqllib/db2profile && /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/scripts/setup -t createDatabases\" To check that the database is created correctly, connect to the database. For example, connect by using IBM Data Studio. The user name is i2analyze and the password is the database password set in the credentials.properties file. If you are using Windows 7, you must forward port 50000 from your Virtual Box virtual machine.) Liberty container The Liberty application server hosts the i2 Analyze application, and provides all of the REST services that the client uses. In this deployment, Liberty is deployed on its own server. Your configured i2 Analyze toolkit, and a Db2 client must be installed on the Liberty server. To build the liberty image, run the following command from the src/images/db2 folder: docker build -t liberty_db2_image liberty The Liberty image is created with the name liberty_db2_image . Run the Liberty container: docker run -d --name liberty -p 9082:9082 -p 9445:9445 --net eianet -u i2analyze liberty_db2_image The i2 Analyze application is installed on the Liberty server. Inspect the Dockerfile in the src/images/db2/liberty directory to see the commands that are run to create the Liberty server in a non-Docker environment. The Liberty server is configured, and the opal-server is started. Results After you complete the previous instructions, i2 Analyze is deployed across five Docker containers. By inspecting the Dockerfiles and the toolkit tasks that are used in the previous commands, you can identify the steps that are required to replicate the distributed deployment in a non-Docker environment. Test the deployment To test the deployment, connect to i2 Analyze from Analyst's Notebook Premium. The URL that you use to connect is: http://i2demo:9082/opal . Log in using the user name Jenny with the password Jenny . You can use the Upload records function to add data to the Information Store, and then search for that data."

    "keywords": "Deploying the distributed deployment example with IBM HTTP Server To deploy the distributed deployment example in a topology that uses the IBM HTTP Server. The following instructions detail what is required on each container, and how to use these steps to deploy i2 Analyze on physical servers. Before you begin Complete the Quick deploy section and your deployment must be running. If you deployed the example with one of the configurations in the configuration_mods directory or changed the topology.xml file, reset your example deployment to the base configuration before you deploy with IBM HTTP Server. To reset your environment, run the following command from the src/scripts directory: ./resetEnvironment You must run all Docker commands from a command line where Docker is initialized. Prerequisites for Deploying i2 Analyze with IBM HTTP Server Obtain the IBM HTTP Server archive for Linux from Fix Central. You download the archive using the following version: 9.0.5-WS-IHS-ARCHIVE-linux-x86_64-FP001 . Rename the .zip file to IHS_ARCHIVE_FILE.zip , then copy it to the src/images/common/ihs_base directory. Deploying i2 Analyze with IBM HTTP Server In the distributed deployment example, the IBM HTTP Server is deployed in its own server. In the Docker environment, if src/images/common/ihs_base/IHS_ARCHIVE_FILE.zip exists, the ihs_image is created when you run the buildImages. The IBM HTTP Server container is started when you run the runContainers script. If you cleaned your environment, rebuild and run the container. To build the IBM HTTP Server image, run the following command from the src/images folder: docker build -t base_ihs_image common/ihs_base --build-arg IHS_ARCHIVE_FILE=IHS_ARCHIVE_FILE.zip docker build -t ihs_image common/ihs The IBM HTTP Server image is created with the name ihs_image .

The Docker environment is not designed to be used on customer sites for test or production systems. After you understand how the distributed deployment is deployed, replicate the deployment on physical servers. Before you begin Complete the Quick deploy section at least once, before you start the manual deployment. The software prerequisites that you download for the Quick deploy are also used here. Complete the Clean your environment section to ensure that none of the images, containers, or network exist. You must run all Docker commands from a command line where Docker is initialized. For Windows 7, you must also forward the required ports from your local workstation to the virtual machine that hosts Docker. In the network settings for your docker virtual machine, open the Advanced menu and click Port Forwarding . Create a new line, and enter values for the Host IP , Host Port , and Guest Port .

Copy the i2 Analyze configuration The i2 Analyze configuration is required by all servers that host components of i2 Analyze, except for the database server. In the src/scripts directory of the distributed deployment example, the copyConfiguration script copies the i2 Analyze configuration from the src/configuration directory to the <container_name>/configuration directory for each container. From the src/scripts directory, run the copyConfiguration script file. ./copyConfiguration Results In a non-Docker environment, copying the configuration is equivalent to the following steps: Download and extract the i2 Analyze toolkit onto a server. Copy the examples/configurations/information-store-opal/configuration directory into the toolkit directory of your extracted i2 Analyze toolkit. You must populate the configuration for your environment, use the src/configuration directory as a reference. This is the centralized i2 Analyze toolkit and configuration that you copy to your servers. Build the prerequisite images In the distributed deployment example, some of the images are built on top of other images. The prerequisite images must be built first, as described in the following section. Ubuntu toolkit image The ubuntu_toolkit_image is an image that contains the Ubuntu operating system with i2 Analyze installed and contains the i2 Analyze configuration. When you build the ubuntu_toolkit_image , the i2analyze.tar.gz that you copied into the src/images/common/ubuntu_toolkit/i2analyze directory as part of the Quick deploy is copied and extracted into the image. To build the Ubuntu toolkit image, run the following from the src/images/common folder: docker build -t ubuntu_toolkit_image ubuntu_toolkit The Ubuntu toolkit image is created with the name ubuntu_toolkit_image . Configuring and running the containers Each Docker container requires a Docker image. In a non-Docker environment, this is equivalent to configuring and starting a physical server that is used to host a component of i2 Analyze. SQL Server container The SQL Server container is built from an image that is available from Microsoft on Docker hub, https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server . To build the sqlserver image, run the following command from the src/images/sqlserver : docker build -t sqlserver_image sqlserver Run the SQL Server container: docker run -d -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e \"SA_PASSWORD=<SAPassword>\" --name sqlserver -p 1433:1433 --net eianet sqlserver_image Where <SAPassword> is a password for the system administrator user for the SQL Server container. Run the following command to add the i2 Analyze user with the required permissions: docker exec -t sqlserver /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -U SA -P <SAPassword> -Q \"CREATE LOGIN i2analyze WITH PASSWORD = '<Password>'; CREATE USER i2analyze FOR LOGIN i2analyze; ALTER SERVER ROLE sysadmin ADD MEMBER i2analyze\" Where <SAPassword> is the same password that you entered in the previous command, and <Password> is the password that you specified in the credentials.properties file for the db.infostore.password credential. The container is started with SQL Server installed and running. The port number of the SQL Server instance is 1433 . ZooKeeper containers ZooKeeper is the service that is used to maintain configuration information and distributed synchronization across Solr. In this deployment, ZooKeeper is distributed across three servers in a ZooKeeper Quorum. Your configured i2 Analyze toolkit must be installed on each Zookeeper server.

Your configured i2 Analyze toolkit, and a Db2 client must be installed on the server that you want to use to interact with Liberty and Db2. To build the Admin client image, run the following command from the src/images/sqlserver folder: docker build -t admin_client_sqlserver_image admin_client The Admin client image is created with the name admin_client_sqlserver_image . Run the Admin client container: docker run -d --name admin_client --net eianet --memory=512m -u i2analyze admin_client_sqlserver_image Inspect the Dockerfile in the src/images/sqlserver/admin_client directory to see the commands that are required to configure the Admin client. Use the following format to run toolkit tasks by using the Admin Client: docker exec -u i2analyze -t admin_client /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/scripts/setup -t <toolkit task> Solr configuration Before the Solr configuration can be created, all of the ZooKeeper hosts must be running. In the Docker environment, ensure that the ZooKeeper containers are running. You can create and upload the Solr configuration from the Admin client, or you can run the command from one of the ZooKeeper servers. To create the Solr configuration by using the Admin client, run the following command: docker exec -u i2analyze -t admin_client /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/scripts/setup -t createAndUploadSolrConfig --hostname admin_client.eianet The Solr configuration is created and uploaded. Solr containers Solr is used to manage the search index in a deployment of i2 Analyze. In this deployment, Solr is distributed across two servers. Your configured i2 Analyze toolkit must be installed on each Solr server. To build the Solr images, run the following commands from the src/images/common folder: docker build -t solr_image solr docker build -t solr2_image solr2 The Solr images are created with the names solr_image and solr2_image . Run the Solr containers: docker run -d --name solr -p 8983:8983 --net eianet --memory=1g -u i2analyze solr_image docker run -d --name solr2 -p 8984:8984 --net eianet --memory=1g -u i2analyze solr2_image Check that the containers started correctly by using the docker logs: docker logs -f solr docker logs -f solr2 Inspect the Dockerfile in src/images/common/solr and src/images/common/solr2 to see the commands that are required to configure a Solr server in a non-Docker environment. The images include an i2 Analyze topology.xml file that defines the values for the configuration of Solr. When the server starts, the appropriate Solr nodes are started. When you start the Solr container, the port that Solr runs on in the container is specified, in this example it is either 8983 or 8984 . The specified port is mapped on the host machine so that you can access Solr and the Solr Web UI from the host machine. After the Solr nodes are running, you can use the Solr Web UI to inspect the Solr and ZooKeeper configurations. Connect to the Solr Web UI on the solr container. In a web browser, go to the following URL to connect to the Solr Web UI: http://localhost:8983/solr/# . The user name is solradmin and the password is the Solr password set in the credentials.properties file. Where the port number is the same as the one that is mapped to local machine when the Solr container is run. The URL uses localhost because the 8983 port is mapped from the host machine to the docker container. In a non-Docker environment, connect by using the host name of the Solr server. Solr collection Before the Solr collection can be created, all of the Solr nodes that the collection comprises must be running. In the Docker environment, ensure that both of the Solr containers are running. You can create the Solr collection from the Admin client, or you can run the command from one of the Solr servers. To create the Solr collection by using the Admin client, run the following command: docker exec -u i2analyze -t admin_client /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/scripts/setup -t createSolrCollections --hostname admin_client.eianet The Solr collection is created. To test the Solr Collection, click Cloud in the Solr Web UI, or you can go to http://localhost:8983/solr/#/~cloud . The user name is solradmin and the password is the Solr password set in the credentials.properties file. A horizontal tree with the collection as the root is displayed. Here you can see the breakdown of the shards, nodes, and replicas on the collection. Create the Information Store database Create the Information Store database in the SQL Server instance on the SQL Server container. To create the Information Store database by using the Admin client, run the following command: docker exec -u i2analyze -t admin_client /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/scripts/setup -t createDatabases To check that the database is created correctly, connect to the database. For example, connect by using SQL Server Management Studio. The user name is i2analyze and the password is the database password set in the credentials.properties file. If you are using Windows 7, you must forward port 1433 from your Virtual Box virtual machine.) Liberty container The Liberty application server hosts the i2 Analyze application, and provides all of the REST services that the client uses. In this deployment, Liberty is deployed on its own server. Your configured i2 Analyze toolkit, and the SQL Server client tools must be installed on the Liberty server. To build the liberty image, run the following command from the src/images/sqlserver folder: docker build -t liberty_sqlserver_image liberty The Liberty image is created with the name liberty_sqlserver_image . Run the Liberty container: docker run -d --name liberty -p 9082:9082 -p 9445:9445 --net eianet --memory=2g -u i2analyze liberty_sqlserver_image The i2 Analyze application is installed on the Liberty server. Inspect the Dockerfile in the src/images/sqlserver/liberty directory to see the commands that are run to create the Liberty server in a non-Docker environment. The Liberty server is configured, and the opal-server is started. Results After you complete the previous instructions, i2 Analyze is deployed across five Docker containers. By inspecting the Dockerfiles and the toolkit tasks that are used in the previous commands, you can identify the steps that are required to replicate the distributed deployment in a non-Docker environment. Test the deployment To test the deployment, connect to i2 Analyze from Analyst's Notebook Premium. The URL that you use to connect is: http://i2demo:9082/opal . Log in using the user name Jenny with the password Jenny . You can use the Upload records function to add data to the Information Store, and then search for that data."

The certificates are stored in keystore files on the client and the server. Certificates are exchanged to establish trust during the handshake process that initiates a secure connection. When a certificate is granted through a certificate authority, that certificate can be trusted by the clients or applications that trust certificates that are signed by that authority. A public key certificate that authenticates a server is stored in a keystore file on the server. Trusted certificate authority certificates are stored in the client's truststore file. As part of the SSL handshake process, certificates are exchanged that are signed by a trusted certificate authority to verify that a certificate is authentic. For more information about the keystores and certificates that are required in an i2 Analyze deployment, see SSL certificates for i2 Analyze and SSL keystores for i2 Analyze . As part of the distributed deployment example, scripts are provided that demonstrate how to create the required keystores and certificates. The certificates are created and signed by a certificate authority, which is also included as part of the example. To create the keystores, certificates, and certificate authority, run the createKeysAndStores script file. These scripts contain comments that explain the processes that are completed. As an overview, a certificate authority image is built and run as a certificate authority container. A keystore, truststore, and private key certificate are created for each component of i2 Analyze. A certificate signing request is created for each certificate. Each signing request is sent to the certificate authority, which signs and returns the certificate. At the end of this process, each container contains a keystore that is populated with its signed private key certificate and a truststore that is populated with the certificate authority's signer certificate. The certificate authority's signer certificate is used to verify the certificates that are received from the other components of i2 Analyze. After you run the createKeysAndStores script, the environment is as follows: In a non-Docker environment, you must ensure that the correct stores and certificates are in place. You can use the example scripts and information in the i2 documentation to identify methods for creating the stores."

    "keywords": "Understanding the distributed deployment example The distributed deployment example demonstrates how to build a distributed deployment of i2 Analyze on multiple servers. To avoid the need for multiple physical servers, Docker is used to simulate the servers. The distributed deployment example not only provides the environment for the deployment, but configures and deploys i2 Analyze across the servers in the same way that a system implementer does. In the distributed deployment example, i2 Analyze with the Opal services is deployed on seven servers: One for Liberty and the i2 Analyze application One for the database management system for the Information Store database Two for each Solr node Three for ZooKeeper that manages the Solr configuration The following diagram shows the servers that i2 Analyze is deployed on, and what is required on each server: In addition to the containers that replicate physical servers in a deployment of i2 Analyze, as part of the distributed deployment example, extra containers are used to configure the Docker environment. These extra containers do not represent physical servers in a non-Docker environment. The additional containers are: Ubuntu toolkit In the example Docker environment, i2 Analyze is installed on the Ubuntu operating system. Each container with i2 Analyze installed is based on this container. Note: Installation of i2 Analyze on Ubuntu is not supported in any environment other than the distributed deployment example. Db2 installer This container contains the prerequisites for Db2 to be installed in the Docker environment. It is used by the Db2 container to install Db2. Base client This container is used to install the Db2 Client. It is used by the Liberty and Admin client containers to install the Db2 Client when you are using Db2 as the database management system. Admin client There are two versions of the admin client container in the example, one for SQL Server and one for Db2. This container contains an installation of i2 Analyze and the client required to connect to the remote database. In the distributed deployment example, this container is used to run commands that impact other containers. In a non-Docker environment, you can run these commands on the specific physical server. Read the following documentation and Dockerfiles to gain an understanding of how to deploy a similar i2 Analyze system in a non-Docker environment, on physical servers. All of the steps that you must complete to deploy a distributed i2 Analyze system are demonstrated in the distributed deployment example. After you deploy the distributed deployment example, information is provided for how to complete configuration tasks in a distributed deployment of i2 Analyze. Host names in a distributed environment When i2 Analyze is deployed in a distributed environment, the topology.xml file contains multiple host names. In the distributed deployment example, the host names that are used include; sqlserver , db2 , solr , solr2 , zookeeper , zookeeper2 , zookeeper3 , and liberty . To deploy and configure i2 Analyze is a distributed environment, you can use the --hostname argument restrict the effect of the toolkit task to the host name that you provide. For example, setup -t startSolrNodes --hostname solr.eianet starts the Solr nodes on the server with the host name solr . If you run setup -t startSolr --hostname solr2.eianet , only the Solr nodes on the server with host name solr2 start. If a toolkit task that you run with a specific host name impacts multiple servers, you must run that toolkit task for each server with their host name specified. Configurations The distributed deployment example includes a number of configurations that can be used to demonstrate a deployment of i2 Analyze. The configuration in the src/configuration directory is the default configuration for the distributed deployment example. i2 Analyze is deployed in the topology that is described above, with the Information Store on SQL Server. The src/configuration_mods directory contains the configuration modifications, separated into database management system, that are required to configure i2 Analyze for specific deployment patterns or features. You can compare the changes in these directories to the src/configuration directory to identify what is required for these deployments. SSL deployments The configurations that include ssl secure connection to and between components of i2 Analyze.

For more information about Docker, see Docker overview . Docker containers and images A Docker container represents a physical server in a non-Docker environment. In the distributed deployment example i2 Analyze is deployed across the Docker containers, this represents the deployment of i2 Analyze across physical servers in a non-Docker environment. In the example, there are Docker images and containers for the servers that host the components of i2 Analyze. Additionally, the Ubuntu toolkit image has the files that make up Ubuntu with the i2 Analyze toolkit installed and the base configuration image contains the i2 Analyze configuration files that are not modified as part of this example. In a non-Docker environment, this might be a server that you are not using as part of the deployment. To simulate starting a server, run a container from its corresponding image. For more information about Docker containers and images, see Docker objects . Dockerfiles In the distributed deployment example, Dockerfiles are used to define what is installed onto the file system and what is run on startup of the server. For more information about Dockerfile definitions, see Dockerfile format . The Dockerfiles are in each src/images/<container_name> directory. You can use a text editor to inspect the Dockerfiles . The Dockerfiles contain the commands that are used to build the Docker image. Some commands in the Dockerfiles are specific to Docker, and required for the distributed deployment example to work in a Docker environment. However, all of the actions or commands that a system implementer must complete in a non-Docker environment are surfaced here. To identify the commands a system implementer requires, you must understand the Dockerfiles . The following instructions are used in commands in the Dockerfiles : The COPY instruction copies files or directories to the file system of the container. To replicate the COPY instruction in a non-Docker environment, copy the files or directories to same location on the physical server that the container represents. The RUN instruction runs commands that add files into the image. It is used to run installers, toolkit commands, and other commands that add files into the image. To replicate the RUN instruction in a non-Docker environment, run the same commands in the same order on the physical server that the container represents. The ENTRYPOINT instruction represents commands that are run at server startup. To replicate the ENTRYPOINT instruction in a non-Docker environment, run the same command on the physical server that the container represents. The ENTRYPOINT also has a command that never completes so that the Docker container continues to run. For example, && tail -f /dev/null . This applies to the Docker environment only. The EXPOSE instruction lists the ports that the container listens on. This is used so that the host machine can access these ports on the Docker network that the containers use. The ENV instruction sets the host name of the Docker container. The host names are used in the topology.xml . Extra instructions in the Dockerfiles : The FROM and MAINTAINER instructions complete Docker specific configuration, and do not need to be replicated in a non-Docker environment."

The following instructions detail what is required on each container, and how to use these steps to upgrade i2 Analyze on physical servers. Before you begin You must have a working distributed deployment of a previous version of i2 Analyze, completed with a previous version of the distributed deployment example at version V.2.2.0. Important: If you are upgrading a distributed deployment that was created by using V1.x of the distributed deployment example, you must not update your distributed deployment example source code. Continue to use the same scripts, images, and containers from V1.x of the distributed deployment example. In addition, you must run any commands on the Docker container as the root user instead of the i2analyze user. For example, docker exec -u root liberty /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/scripts/setup -t stopLiberty instead of docker exec -u i2analyze liberty /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/scripts/setup -t stopLiberty . Prerequisites for upgrading the distributed deployment Download, install, and configure the prerequisites for upgrading a distributed deployment. Example code Clone or download the distributed deployment example from https://github.com/i2group/analyze-deployment/releases . Remove the current distributed example code, but ensure the containers stay running. Extract the distributed Example that you just downloaded. i2 Analyze Download i2 Analyze for Linux. You download the IBM_I2A_V4.3.5_LINUX.tar.gz version 4.3.5 by using the usual mechanism. Rename the tar.gz file to i2analyze.tar.gz . Copy the archive file to the src/images/common/ubuntu_toolkit/i2analyze directory. Add the mssql-jdbc-7.4.1.jre11.jar file to the src/configuration/environment/common/jdbc-drivers directory and remove the previous jre8 file. Note: Download the Microsoft JDBC Driver 7.4 for SQL Server from Microsoft JDBC Driver 7.4 for SQL Server . Extract the contents of the tar.gz , and locate the sqljdbc_7.4\\enu\\mssql-jdbc-7.4.1.jre11.jar file. Analyst's Notebook Premium Download i2 Analyst's Notebook Premium version 9.3.1 by using the usual mechanism. Upgrade Analyst's Notebook Premium. For more information, see Upgrading i2 Analyst's Notebook Premium . Preparing i2 Analyze Back up and install i2 Analyze before you upgrade i2 Analyze. Stopping Liberty Before you upgrade your deployment, you must stop the application server. To stop Liberty, run the following command on the liberty container: docker exec -u i2analyze liberty /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/scripts/setup -t stopLiberty The console output from the stopLiberty task is output directly to the console. Backing up the configuration Before you upgrade your deployment, you must backup your current configuration. In the distributed deployment example, the backupConfiguration script creates a copy of your configuration directory on the admin_client container. The backup of your configuration is in the src/configuration_mods/configuration_backup directory. In a non-Docker environment, ensure that you have a copy of the configuration directory that contains your complete configuration in a location outside of the i2 Analyze toolkit. The process of upgrading i2 Analyze removes the deployment toolkit from each server in the deployment. Ensure that the backup of your configuration is up-to-date for each server in your deployment. Installing i2 Analyze You must install version 4.3.5 of i2 Analyze on each server in the deployment. In the distributed deployment example, you can use the installToolkit script to install i2 Analyze on each container. To install i2 Analyze on each container, run the following command from the src/scripts directory: ./installToolkit ./images/common/ubuntu_toolkit/i2analyze/i2analyze.tar.gz In a non-Docker environment, install i2 Analyze on each server by using the following instructions: Upgrading i2 Analyze . Copying the backed up configuration In the distributed deployment example, you upgrade the configuration on the admin_client container. You must copy the backed up configuration of the deployment toolkit to the Admin Client. To copy your backed up configuration to the admin_client container, run the following command from the src directory: docker cp ./configuration_mods/configuration_backup admin_client:/opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/configuration When the directory is copied, the owner of the directory, and all files within it, is changed. The user that runs the deployment script must be able to write to files within the configuration directory. To change the ownership of the directory and the files, run the following command: docker exec -u root admin_client chown -R i2analyze:i2analyze /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/configuration The configuration is now on the admin_client container. In a non-Docker environment, copy your backed up configuration directory to the i2analyze/toolkit/configuration directory on your equivalent of the Admin Client server. You can complete a quick upgrade or you can upgrade manually. Completing the upgrade manually requires you to run each of the steps completed automatically in the quick upgrade. By upgrading manually, you can see in detail what is required on each container and how to use this to upgrade a deployment on physical servers. Quick upgrade To upgrade the example distributed deployment, a script is provided that upgrades i2 Analyze and its components. To upgrade your deployment, run the ./upgradeDeployment script from the src/scripts directory. All of the components of i2 Analyze are upgraded and the application is started. You can test the deployment by completing the steps in Testing the deployment . Upgrade the deployment manually Upgrading and copying the configuration Upgrade the i2 Analyze configuration to version 4.3.5. To upgrade the configuration, run the following command on the admin_client container: docker exec -u i2analyze -t admin_client /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/scripts/setup -t upgradeConfiguration The console output from the upgradeConfiguration task is output directly to the console. The upgraded configuration must be copied to each of the servers in the deployment. In a Docker environment, first you must copy the upgraded configuration to your local machine by running the following command inside the src/scripts directory: For SQL Server: docker cp admin_client:/opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/configuration ../configuration_mods/sqlserver/configuration_upgraded For Db2: docker cp admin_client:/opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/configuration ../configuration_mods/db2/configuration_upgraded Then, copy the upgraded configuration to each server. In the distributed deployment example, you can run the updateServerConfigurations script to copy the configuration to each container: ./updateServerConfigurations configuration_upgraded In a non-Docker environment, copy the upgraded configuration to the i2analyze/toolkit/configuration directory on each server. Upgrading and starting the components of i2 Analyze After the upgraded configuration is present on each server, you must upgrade each component of the deployment to version 4.3.5. You must upgrade and start the components of a deployment in the order that they are described here. Upgrading ZooKeeper To upgrade ZooKeeper, run the following command on the zookeeper , zookeeper2 and zookeeper3 containers: docker exec -u i2analyze zookeeper /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/scripts/setup -t upgradeZookeeper --hostname zookeeper.eianet docker exec -u i2analyze zookeeper2 /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/scripts/setup -t upgradeZookeeper --hostname zookeeper2.eianet docker exec -u i2analyze zookeeper3 /opt/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit/scripts/setup -t upgradeZookeeper --hostname zookeeper3.eianet The console output from the upgradeZookeeper task is output directly to the console.

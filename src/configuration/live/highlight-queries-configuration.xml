  This is a complete, valid highlight query configuration file that you can use as you develop your
  deployment of i2 Analyze. Using this file in the deployment toolkit instructs the server to
  create a set of simple highlight queries from the information in the i2 Analyze schema.
  
  When you write your own highlight queries, you must omit the 'automatic' attribute from the
  'highlightQueryGroups' element (or set its value to "false"). It is not valid to request automatic
  creation and define custom highlight queries in the same configuration file.
